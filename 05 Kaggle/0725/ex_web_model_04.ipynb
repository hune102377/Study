      "[TITLE]: Pope arrives in Canada on tour of 'penance' for indigenous abuse\n",
      "[BODY]:\n",
      " EDMONTON, Alberta, July 24 (Reuters) - Pope Francis landed in Canada on Sunday to kick off a week-long trip that will center around his apology on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church for the abuse that indigenous children endured at mostlychurch-run residential schools.\n",
      "\"This is a trip of penance. Let's say that is its spirit,\" the pope told reporters after his flight took off from Rome.\n",
      "The papal planetouched down in Edmonton in the western province of Alberta, where he will visit a former residential school and meet with indigenous peoples on Monday. He is also visiting Quebec City and Iqaluit, the capital of the territory of Nunavut. He will depart on Friday.\n",
      "Between 1881 and 1996 more than 150,000 indigenous children were separated from their families and brought to residential schools. Many children were starved, beaten and sexually abused in a system that Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission called \"cultural genocide.\"\n",
      "The papal plane taxied with Canadian and Vatican flags flapping outside the cockpit windows. After disembarking with the help of a lift, the pope boarded a white Fiat 500X, which dropped him at the hangar. He then proceeded by wheelchair.\n",
      "Governor General Mary Simon, who represents Canada's head of state, Queen Elizabeth, was the first to greet the pope. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau followed.\n",
      "The pope sat between the two Canadian officials for a short performance of four drummers and native singing before several indigenous leaders, many wearing elaborate headdresses, greeted and exchanged gifts with him.\n",
      "\"I asked today the pope to walk with us,\" Grand Chief George Arcand of the Confederacy of Treaty Six First Nations said in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. \"It was a very humbling experience to talk to your holiness.\"\n",
      "RoseAnne Archibald, national chief for the Assembly of First Nations, who also greeted the pope, criticized the \"unilateral\" organization of the trip and the \"archaic\" nature of the church, which has no women in leadership positions.\n",
      "Pope Francis is welcomed after arriving at Edmonton International Airport, near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada July 24, 2022. REUTERS/Guglielmo Mangiapane\n",
      "\"We don't feel that it has been about survivors\" of residential schools, she told reporters at the airport. \"It has been more about the church promoting the church's idea, fundraising for the church.\"\n",
      "The pope left after the short ceremony in a wheelchair to speak for a few minutes in private with Trudeau and other officials before heading to St. Joseph Seminary, where he is expected to rest before Monday's events.\n",
      "The 85-year-old pope canceled a trip to Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan in early July because of a knee problem that has recently forced him to use a wheelchair and a cane.\n",
      "Earlier aboard the papal plane, the pope said he yearned to visit Ukraine in his efforts to try and bring an end to the five-month-old war that he has repeatedly decried.  read more \n",
      "\"I have a great desire to go to Kyiv,\" the pope said when asked about a possible future trip to Ukraine.\n",
      "In an exclusive interview earlier this month, the pontiff told Reuters that he hoped to be able to go to Moscow and Kyiv soon after his trip to Canada.  read more \n",
      "While Canada's leaders have known about high numbers of children dying at the residential schools since 1907, the issue was thrust to the fore with the discovery of suspected unmarked graves at or near former residential school sites last year.\n",
      "In response to pressure stemming from those discoveries, the pope apologized for the Catholic church's role in the schools earlier this year during a visit by indigenous delegates to the Vatican.  read more \n",
      "Now he is preparing to apologize on Canadian soil. But survivors and indigenous leaders have told Reuters they want more.  read more \n",
      "Many have called for financial compensation, the return of indigenous artifacts, the release of school records, support for extraditing an accused abuser, and the rescinding of a 15th-century doctrine justifying colonial dispossession of indigenous people in the form of a papal bull, or edict.  read more \n",

      " High-rise buildings are seen at the Shinjuku business district during sunset in Tokyo, Japan, May 31, 2018. REUTERS/Toru Hanai\n",
      "TOKYO, July 25 (Reuters) - Japan's asset managers nudged the volume up another notch at shareholder meetings this year, increasingly opposing management proposals and adding momentum to a policy of attracting foreign investors initiated by slain former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n",
      "Nikko Asset Management, Asset Management One and others have become distinct voices in Japan's new-found activism, countering foreign criticism of asset managers' rubber-stamp voting.\n",
      "The pair opposed management at a domestic firm by voting for board nominees proposed by a foreign investor, while in another high-profile case, company management canned a proposal after some asset managers supported a foreign investor's objection.\n",
      "This year's cases add to a gradual change in voting sparked by Abe's corporate stewardship code in 2014, and which gained impetus in 2017 with a revision requiring the disclosure of voting records for each agenda item at shareholder meetings. Abe was shot and killed this month during an election campaign.\n",
      "The revision \"raised asset managers' commitment because every manager is held accountable for each voting decision,\" said Katsuya Kikuchi, associate director at Tokio Marine Asset Management.\n",
      "Increased domestic activism is likely to help firms burnish credentials on issues as varied as the environment, society and governance, raising their appeal for foreign investors looking to increase exposure to Japan, asset managers said.\n",
      "Domestic asset managers have voted \"against management in increasing amounts every year for the last five years,\" said Seth Fischer, founder of Hong Kong-based Oasis Management, which has invested in Japanese firms including Toshiba Corp (6502.T).\n",
      "Still, only a fraction of shareholder proposals gain support from domestic institutional investors. Last year, these investors supported just 6.8% of such proposals on average at shareholder meetings served by electric voting platform operator ICJ, versus 15% among foreign counterparts.\n",
      "Foreigners lead shareholder activism in Japan with domestic asset managers mainly playing a supportive role, though some investors have said they hope domestic managers will take more initiative and make their own proposals for company management.\n",
      "Some domestic asset managers supported Oasis which queried related-party transactions at Fujitec Co Ltd (6406.T) and opposed a management proposal to nominate its chief executive to the board of directors. The elevator maker withdrew the proposal an hour before its annual shareholder meeting last month.\n",
      "In another vote this year, Singapore-based 3D Investment Partners' campaign to bring its nominees onto the board of IT firm Fuji Soft Inc (9749.T) received unexpectedly high support of nearly 40%.\n",
      "Those voting in favour included Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc's (8306.T) Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking, Mizuho Financial Group Inc's (8411.T) Asset Management One and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc's (8309.T) Nikko Asset Management.\n",
      "\"Before 2014, we'd hear investee firms moan about foreign investors' strict voting policies,\" said Hidenori Yoshikawa, corporate governance consultant at Daiwa Institute of Research. \"But as domestic institutional investors tightened their stance, we now hear investees say domestic investors are stricter.\"\n",
      "Domestic asset managers have been less supportive of company management than some global peers, showed a report by shareholder advisory SquareWell Partners which analysed voting for incumbent director elections at Japan's 100 biggest firms.\n",
      "Average support rates from 2019 to 2021 stood at 95.9% at Asset Management One, 94.2% at Nikko Asset Management and 88.9% at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management. That compared with 99.9% and 99.7% at U.S. peers Vanguard and BlackRock respectively.\n",
      "Still, it is rare for an activist shareholder motion to win approval in Japan where only four cases have been successful, partly as management is often insulated by passive ownership.\n",
      "But domestic asset managers are increasingly turning on management-protecting schemes, such as takeover defences and cross-shareholding arrangements.\n",
      "Daiwa Securities Group Inc's (8601.T) Daiwa Asset Management and other major asset managers this year tightened rules for director voting at firms engaged in cross-shareholding, which still account for about 30% of Japan's $6 trillion stock market.\n",
      "Also driving change is greater scrutiny from asset owners such as the Government Pension Investment Fund and Pension Fund Association for Local Government Officials, asset managers said.\n",
      "There is also room for improvement in board independence and diversity, said Takuya Iyoda, chief analyst at Nissay Asset Management. Rules could be tightened to the extent that boards must have a majority of independent directors, he said.\n",
      "\"I wouldn't be surprised if requirements for diversity eventually expand to include not just women but also non-Japanese.\"\n",

      "[BODY]:\n",
      " July 24 (Reuters) - Firefighters deployed air tankers, bulldozers and hand crews to battle a fast-moving wildfire just west of Yosemite National Park on Sunday that suddenly grew into one of the largest fires of the year, forcing thousands of evacuations.\n",
      "Fueled by extreme heat and tinder-dry forests and underbrush, the Oak Fire that began on Friday closed within half a mile (0.8 km) from the town of Mariposa Pines, population 1,400, but was still more than 10 miles (16 km) from Yosemite, famed for its giant, ancient sequoia trees.\n",
      "As of Sunday morning, the fire had consumed 14,281 acres (5,780 hectares), more than half the size of Paris, and was zero percent contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).\n",
      "More than 3,000 people were under mandatory evacuation orders and another 2,000 were under a fire advisory, meaning they could soon be ordered to leave, a Cal Fire spokesperson said.\n",
      "The Oak Fire burns near Darrah in Mariposa County, California, U.S. July 24, 2022.  REUTERS/David Swanson\n",
      "Firefighters had the most success establishing fire retention lines on the western side of the fire, but the fire also encroached further east toward the town of Mariposa Pines and in the direction of Yosemite, said Justin Macomb, a Cal Fire operations section chief, in a midday briefing.\n",
      "\"The fire is roughly about a half a mile away from Mariposa Pines at this time, but we have a good plan for today to protect the community of Mariposa Pines,\" Macomb said.\n",
      "The cause of the fire remained under investigation.\n",
      "Yosemite, about an hour's drive from Mariposa County, is home to some of the largest and oldest sequoia trees in the world. The trees had been threatened by another wildfire earlier this month, but firefighters managed to save them.\n",
      "More than two decades of drought and rising temperatures have conspired to make California more vulnerable than ever to wildfires, with the two most devastating years on record coming in 2020 and 2021, when more than 6.8 million acres (2.75 million hectares) burned, an area greater than the size of Rwanda.\n",

      "Yellen, who previously served as chair of the Federal Reserve, hopes the Fed can cool the economy enough to bring down prices without triggering a broad economic downturn.  read more \n",
      "\"I'm not saying that we will definitely avoid a recession,\" Yellen said. \"But I think there is a path that keeps the labor market strong and brings inflation down.\"\n",
      "U.S. gross domestic product, a broad measure of economic health, shrank at a 1.6% annual rate in the first quarter, and a report on Thursday is expected to show a gain of just 0.4% in the second quarter, according to economists polled by Reuters.\n",

      "MEXICO CITY, July 24 (Reuters) - Diana Kennedy, a British-born food writer whose dedication to Mexico's culinary heritage helped popularize the richness of the national cuisine in the English-speaking world, has died. She was 99.\n",
      "The Mexican culture ministry confirmed her death, and paid tribute to Kennedy's legacy, saying that she \"like few others\" understood that conserving nature and its diversity was crucial to upholding the myriad culinary traditions of Mexico.\n",
      "Arturo Sarukhan, a former Mexican ambassador to the United States, on Twitter described the death of the \"great\" Kennedy as a \"huge loss for Mexico, the UK and Mexican gastronomy.\"\n",
      "\"She changed the narrative and perceptions of Mexican cuisine from a bland mish-mash of TexMex towards a sophisticated tapestry of regional cuisines\" as rich as those celebrated in China, India, France or Italy, Sarukhan told Reuters.\n",
      "Kennedy, whose works include \"The Cuisines of Mexico\" and \"The Art of Mexican Cooking\", was born as Diana Southwood in Loughton, England in 1923 and emigrated to Canada in 1953.\n",
      "Later in the decade, she moved to Mexico after marrying New York Times journalist Paul P. Kennedy. Her husband died in 1967, and Kennedy spent years living in Michoacan, a rugged state in western Mexico with a strong, deep-rooted culture.\n",
      "It was at her home in Michoacan that she died on Sunday, the New York Times said. The cause of death was not clear.\n",
      "Plaudits flooded in on Twitter for Kennedy, including from renowned chef Jose Andres, who, calling her his friend, wrote:\n",
      "\"She loved Mexico, Mexicans and Mexican cooking like no one! Her books open a window into the soul of Mexico! She gave voice to the many Mexican cooks, specially women. She was my teacher and already miss her. Will cook together one day again!\"\n",
      "Josefa Gonzalez Blanco, Mexico's ambassador to Britain called Kennedy a \"remarkable woman\" who had put her \"heart and soul\" into researching, chronicling and promoting the vast diversity of Mexican culture and gastronomy.\n",
      "Kennedy won many prizes in recognition of her work, and in 1981 the government honored her with the Mexican Order of the Aztec Eagle, the country's highest award for foreigners.\n",
      "According to her website, Kennedy was compelled to preserve native ingredients and traditional recipes under threat from growing urbanization, and spent decades documenting cuisines she found in villages, markets and homes across Mexico.\n",

      "More than 40% of Romania's population of 20 million live in the countryside and many rely on subsistence agriculture on small plots of land. The country has massive investment needs in infrastructure, including roads, running water and irrigation.\n",
      "Romania's weather agency issued temperature warnings for Sunday, adding torrential storms would follow, although it said temperatures would remain abnormally high. Water levels on the river Danube were three times lower than usual.\n",
      "\"The drought period is fairly cruel, not just for this place, but for the entire country,\" said Father Justinian, one of several priests who held the service at the Pantocrator. The priests prayed in a field of harvested wheat across from the monastery, with sunflower and maize fields withering nearby.\n",
